# Stack Overflow for HH

Someone mentioned this in a facebook comment so I figured might as well make  a really simple version with Meteor while I wait for a freind.


##v1.0 goals

* FB Authenticated users who are in HH group can use the site.
* Any HH can post questions
* Any HH can see a list of questions and answer them
* Use tags to filter questions (i.e.: HTML, CSS, Ruby, etc.)
* Each question is a start of a thread, 

Question: 
- title: How to do X?
- body: I would like to know how to do X. I am doing Y and getting Y.
- submitter: UserA
- answers: [
  - answer: 
    - body: "You should try `blah blah`"
    - user: UserX 
  - answer:
    - body: "Actually `foobar` works better"
    - user:  UserY
  ]
